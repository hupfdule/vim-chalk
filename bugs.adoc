- [ ] Calculation of the nested fold level is also not working.
      See this example:

      function! s:bar() abort " ............................................ {{{1
        if 1 == 2
          echo "nudel"
        endif
      endfunction " ........................................................ }}}1
+
      Calling <Plug>Chalk from `if` to `endif` creates a new fold of level
      1 instead of level 2.

- [ ] <Plug>ChalkUp and <Plug>ChalkDown also operate only on the selection
      and not on the current fold (as the documentation pretends). This
      again a problem in normal mode. Visual mode mapping works.

- [ ] nmap for <Plug>ChalkDown is not working.
      vmap _is_ working however.
      nmap for <Plug>ChalkUp is also working.
      The command :ChalkDown is _also_ working!

- [ ] Allow specifying chalk_char on fold creation. For example I normally
      want only spaces for padding. But in some cases, like my ftplugins I
      want to use folds for extra structuring and like to have visible
      separator chars.

      On fold creation could be problematic, since chalk allows realigning
      folds. Maybe it would be better to have a buffer local b:chalk_char
      (and in that respect different chars per level).
      But how can chalk identify that a file it has read should have a a
      specific b:chalk_char without having the user specify it every time?
      → This is not possibe via modeline.
      Maybe we could get around this by not only using the chalk_char when
      _adding_ a fold, but not when _aligning_ it. Aligning would then
      always use the chalk_char that is already there.
      This has one caveat. What to do when changing the fold level (only
      problematic when specifying different chalk_chars per level)? Check
      if the current fill char is the same as the chalk_char for the
      current level and only then adapting it?

- [ ] Allow different separator chars (chalk_char) for each level. Work on
      this was already done, but makes problems inside some regex.

- [x] When adding a fold marker chalk is not adding a space between the
      text and the leading ". This breaks most syntax.
      +
      This also happens with vims builtin zf. Maybe there is some vimrc
      setting breaking it…
      +
      → This is specified via `b:chalk_space_before`.

- [x] Why is Chalk leaving me in replace mode after adding a fold?
      +
      → This is specified via `b:chalk_edit`.
